#	• Description: Identifies and terminates processes using excessive CPU resources (above a defined threshold).
#	• Usage: Automate the management of runaway processes that are affecting server performance.

# Define CPU Threshold (in percentage)
$CpuThreshold = 90

# Get Processes Consuming CPU Over the Threshold
$HighCpuProcesses = Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.CPU -gt $CpuThreshold }

# Display High CPU Processes
if ($HighCpuProcesses) {
    Write-Host "High CPU Processes Detected:" -ForegroundColor Red
    $HighCpuProcesses | Select-Object Name, CPU | Format-Table

# Optionally, Terminate High CPU Processes
    $HighCpuProcesses | ForEach-Object {
        Write-Host "Terminating Process: $($_.Name)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
        Stop-Process -Id $_.Id -Force
    }
} else {
    Write-Host "No processes are consuming high CPU." -ForegroundColor Green
}
