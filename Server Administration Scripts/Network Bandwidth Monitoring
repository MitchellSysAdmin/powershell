#	• Description: Monitors network bandwidth usage for a specific network interface and triggers alerts if thresholds are exceeded.
#	• Usage: Helps monitor and troubleshoot network bandwidth consumption in real time.

# Define Network Interface
$InterfaceName = "Ethernet"

# Get Network Adapter Statistics
$NetStats = Get-NetAdapterStatistics -Name $InterfaceName

# Display Interface Bandwidth Usage
Write-Host "Network Bandwidth Utilization for $InterfaceName:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "Received Bytes: $([math]::round($NetStats.ReceivedBytes / 1MB, 2)) MB"
Write-Host "Sent Bytes: $([math]::round($NetStats.SentBytes / 1MB, 2)) MB"
Write-Host "Packets Received: $($NetStats.ReceivedPackets)"
Write-Host "Packets Sent: $($NetStats.SentPackets)"

# Set a bandwidth threshold (in MB) for alert
$ReceivedThreshold = 500 # in MB
$SentThreshold = 500 # in MB
if ($NetStats.ReceivedBytes / 1MB -gt $ReceivedThreshold) {
    Write-Host "Alert: High Received Bandwidth Usage!" -ForegroundColor Red
}
if ($NetStats.SentBytes / 1MB -gt $SentThreshold) {
    Write-Host "Alert: High Sent Bandwidth Usage!" -ForegroundColor Red
}
